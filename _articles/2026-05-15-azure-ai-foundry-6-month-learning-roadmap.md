## Suggested monthly mentor checkpoints

- End of Month 1: Can the learner explain AI concepts in Azure infrastructure language?
- End of Month 2: Can the learner identify which Foundry capability fits which workload?
- End of Month 3: Can the learner build a basic generative AI or RAG prototype?
- End of Month 4: Can the learner design AI-ready Azure infrastructure with governance and observability?
- End of Month 5: Can the learner describe a production deployment flow and control model?
- End of Month 6: Can the learner present an end-to-end Azure AI solution with Foundry and surrounding Azure services?

## Recommended mentor emphasis areas

- Push beyond theory: every month should end with a small artifact, not just completed modules.
- Keep the learner in architecture mode: always ask why a service is needed and what risk it addresses.
- Tie new AI learning back to existing strengths: networking, identity, monitoring, governance, and automation are major differentiators for infrastructure professionals moving into AI.
- Avoid overfocusing on model training early: for this learner, deployment architecture, governance, and operationalization are the highest-value first moves.

## Optional certification direction

If the learner wants exam-aligned outcomes after this roadmap:

- Azure fundamentals refresh: align with AZ-900 style infrastructure grounding.
- AI foundation: align with the current Microsoft Learn AI introductory path.
- Longer-term role growth: target Azure AI engineering and solution architecture capabilities after the capstone.

## Success criteria at 6 months

The roadmap is successful if the learner can:

- Design an Azure AI solution centered on Microsoft Foundry.
- Explain the role of AI Search, identity, storage, monitoring, and deployment hosting around that solution.
- Build or supervise a small RAG or agent-based proof of concept.
- Define governance, security, cost, and observability requirements for production readiness.
- Present a practical Azure-first AI deployment roadmap for a real business use case.
