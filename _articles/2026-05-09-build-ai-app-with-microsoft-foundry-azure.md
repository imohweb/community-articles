## What we will build

A fully working **AI Agent–powered Customer Support App** running on Azure:

- **Frontend** — React 18 + Vite + TypeScript on Azure App Service
- **Backend** — Python 3.11 + FastAPI on Azure App Service
- **AI** — Microsoft Foundry Agent (`gpt-4o-mini`) with three function tools:
  `create_ticket`, `lookup_ticket`, `list_open_tickets`
- **Data** — Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible + Azure Blob Storage
- **Identity** — Managed Identity end-to-end, no API keys
- **IaC** — Bicep, deployed with Azure Developer CLI (`azd up`)

## Three deployment paths covered

1. **Local** — `uvicorn` + `npm run dev` for inner-loop coding.
2. **`azd up`** — one-shot provisioning + deployment of the whole stack.
3. **GitHub Actions** — CI per layer (`backend-ci`, `frontend-ci`, `infra-ci`) plus
   a `deploy-azd` workflow that runs `azd up` from CI using **OIDC federated credentials**
   — no client secrets in the repo.

## Production hardening focus

A dedicated section on **Azure Key Vault**: why secrets must never live in `.env`,
how to wire `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=…)` references into App Service config,
and why **Managed Identity + RBAC** is the modern alternative to access policies.

## Repo

The full source code, Bicep templates, GitHub Actions workflows, and demo script
are open-sourced at:

## Recording

[Build AI App with Microsoft Foundry & Azure - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5vbO_SvmyA)

This Part 1 recording is from the May 9, 2026 technical hands-on lab. During the live session,
the backend app failed, so participants did not get the end-to-end application flow demo.
Part 2 of the video will capture the completed app-flow demo and will be added to this page
when it is available.
